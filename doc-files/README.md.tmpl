## Installation

```
npm install geojson2h3
```

## Example Usage

```javascript
import geojson2h3 from 'geojson2h3';

const polygon = {
  type: 'Feature',
  geometry: {
    type: 'Polygon',
    coordinates: [[
      [-122.47485823276713, 37.85878356045377],
      [-122.47504834087829, 37.86196795698972],
      [-122.47845104316997, 37.86010614563313],
      [-122.47485823276713, 37.85878356045377]
    ]]
  }
};

const hexagons = geojson2h3.featureToH3Set(polygon, 10);
// -> ['8a2830855047fff', '8a2830855077fff', '8a283085505ffff', '8a283085506ffff']

const feature = geojson2h3.h3SetToFeature(hexagons);
// -> {type: 'Feature', properties: {}, geometry: {type: 'Polygon', coordinates: [...]}}
```
